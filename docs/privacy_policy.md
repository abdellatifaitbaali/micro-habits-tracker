# Privacy Policy for Micro-Habits Tracker

**Effective Date: December 27, 2025**

The Micro-Habits Tracker is designed with a "Privacy-by-Design" philosophy. This app is an "Offline-First" application, meaning that all data you input, including habit names, frequencies, and streaks, is stored locally on your device's internal storage using an encrypted-ready SQLite database. No data is ever transmitted to external servers, cloud providers, or third-party analytics services.

We do *not* collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII), location data, contact lists, or unique device identifiers (UIDs). The app requires zero permissions to operate, ensuring that your digital footprint remains entirely within your control. There is no background tracking, no account creation, and no hidden telemetry.

To give you full control over your information, a "Delete All My Data" function is provided within the app's Settings menu. Executing this command permanently erases the local database from your device. Since we do not maintain any backups or cloud sync, this action is irreversible and ensures that your data is completely purged upon your request.
